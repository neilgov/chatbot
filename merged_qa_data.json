        "How do you troubleshoot DNS resolution failures?": "Use the nslookup command to test DNS resolution for specific domain names and identify which DNS server is being queried. Check the DNS server's configuration to ensure that forward and reverse lookup zones are correctly set up and contain the necessary records. Review the DNS server's event logs for errors or warnings related to DNS service failures. Flush the DNS cache on the client computer using the ipconfig /flushdns command to remove any stale entries. Verify that the client computer's DNS settings are pointing to the correct DNS server and that the server is reachable. Test connectivity to the DNS server using ping or tracert to identify any network issues. If necessary, restart the DNS server service or reboot the server to resolve the issue.",
        "How do you resolve Windows Activation issues on a server?": "Verify that the product key used for activation is valid and has not been used on more servers than allowed by the license. Use the slmgr.vbs /dli command to display the activation status and license information of the server. If the server is not activated, use the slmgr.vbs /ipk <ProductKey> command to install a valid product key. Attempt to activate the server online using the slmgr.vbs /ato command. If online activation fails, use the phone activation option by running slui.exe 4 and following the prompts. Check for connectivity issues that may prevent the server from reaching Microsoft's activation servers. Review the activation logs in Event Viewer or C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\log\\ActivationLog.xml for detailed error information.",
        "How do you troubleshoot Group Policy not applying to users or computers?": "Run the gpresult /r command on the affected computer to generate a report of applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs). Use the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) to review the scope and filtering of the GPOs to ensure they apply to the correct users or computers. Check for any conflicting or higher-precedence GPOs that might be overriding the settings in the desired GPO. Verify that the affected computer is connected to the domain and can reach the domain controller. Review the event logs on the client computer for Group Policy-related errors or warnings. Use the gpupdate /force command to manually refresh Group Policy on the client computer. If necessary, enable Group Policy debugging by modifying the registry and reviewing the detailed logs in C:\\Windows\\debug\\usermode.",
        "How do you resolve Kerberos authentication issues?": "Check the server's time synchronization with the domain controller, as Kerberos requires time to be within 5 minutes of the domain controller. Use the klist command to list the Kerberos tickets on the client computer and verify their validity. If the Kerberos ticket has expired, use the klist purge command to clear the ticket cache and force the client to request a new ticket. Ensure that the Service Principal Name (SPN) is correctly registered for the service being accessed. Review the event logs on both the client computer and the domain controller for Kerberos-related errors or warnings. Verify that the DNS configuration is correct, as Kerberos relies on DNS for locating domain controllers."
